## Overview
Before the competition was announced this was the focal point of the project. It is able to make portfolio optimization decisions for t+1 based on price information from t.
However, since the objective has changed with Kaggle to having to predict 152 days into the future, there's need to predict future prices which is not something an RL agent is designed to do.
We did adapt the agent to work optimization for the 152 predicted price data and try to optimize the portfolio. However, since in that case we already "know" the future prices (i.e. predicted prices) it becomes a closed optimization problem which we can use constraint optimization for.
We decided to use another regressor to help determine the weighting between the DDPG output and conic optimization output. 

## Architecture
### Components
![project architecture](assets/architecture.png)

Legend:
- orange: input data csv files
- yellow: interim output data csv files
- blue: deep learning and reinforcement learning models
- purple: conic optimizer
- green: final output (weights)

### How to use
See more specific instructions on how to run each component. This is an overview of how things fit together
1. Get X years of price change data and X years of market variable data (periods must match)
2. Feed both independently into LSTM (see below `prices_main.py`). These runs will produce two files with X years + k days of all predicted data
3. Feed both new predicted price change and market factor data csv files into fully connected regressor (see `estimator_main.py` below). This will generate the final predicted X years + k days price change data in a csv file
4. Feed price change data to RL agent (see `main.py` below). This will produce a new csv with predicted optimal weights for k days
5. Feed X years of original X year price change data and X years of predicted price change data from (3) into conic optimizer. This will generate predicted optimal weights for X years
6. Feed original X year price change data to conic optimizer to get optimal weights (see `optimizer_main.py` below). This will generate ground truth optimal weights for X years
7. Feed predicted optimal weights from DDPG in (4) and predicted optimal weights from conic optimizer in (5) into regressor (see `estimator_main.py` below again) and train with optimal weights from (6) as ground truth labels
8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 one more time with new predicted k days generated by regressor in (3)



## DDPG

### Overview

## Constrained optimizer

### Overview
This is a SLSQP optimizer which takes price change data and optimizes it to weights of the same dimensions as the input.
It uses a lookback window of k days and a lookahead window of 1 day.
It is used both:
1. For producing part of the input data to the final optimal weights NN regressor (in which case the 1 day lookahead is on predicted price change data).
2. For producing the ground truth labels to the final optimal weights NN regressor (in which case the 1 day lookahead is on ground truth price change data)
In both cases the lookback window uses the ground truth price data.  
Note: this is a costly computation. It takes time. Use multithreading if possible.

### How to run
Run `python optimizer_main.py [...optional run args]`

### Run args
- input_path_real: full path to csv file with real price change data
- input_path_predicted: full path to csv file with predicted price change data [Optional]
- output_path: full path to optimal weights csv file to be saved 
- limit_days: limit total days considered from the end
- exclude_predicted_days: number of days to exclude from predicted data (useful since predicted data should have +152 predicted days over the ground truth data)
- lookback_window: days to use for lookback
- weight_min: lower bound for desired weights
- weight_max: upper bound for desired weights
- num_threads: for multithreading
